Wrap_Pdf is yet another wrapper class for Zend_Pdf that aims to simplify
a few basic operations, such as writing wrapped text and placing images.

It is by no means a full-featured class. In its current form it is more
of a example of how to use Zend_Pdf to accomplish the basic things that
it accomplishes. However, it could certainly be used as the basis for a
much more elaborate solution.
