This is a simple paragraph of text that is being used to demonstrate the automatic line wrapping that is implemented
within the Wrap_Pdf class. If you check the source text (located in resources/p1.txt), you will notice that while it
does have line breaks, they are not at the same point in the PDF file as they are in the source text. That's because
the writeText() method replaces all line breaks with spaces. Well, it replaces Mac-style line feeds anyway... if your
results are different it might be because line 355 requires some tweaking.
